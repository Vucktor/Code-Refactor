# Code-Refactor

## Description

I have modified an existing codebase to meet with accessibility standards by using HTML semantics alongside modifying CSS to apply to the new HTML semantics and accessibility changes and reducing any overlaps or repeats of pre existing styles.

By doing this it allows the codebase to be easier to read and understand making it easier to make modifications and allowing all future and current developers to understand what the code is made for.

This has personally allowed me to gain a further understanding of proper accessibility standards and where to use HTML semantics.

## Credits

I have used other sites to help me gain a better understanding of what HTML semantics to use this includes, https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp.
